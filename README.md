🎓 Smart Quiz Application

This is my Smart Quiz Application project built using Python (Tkinter).

It’s a simple but powerful quiz game where users can test their knowledge in multiple categories, choose difficulty levels, use hints, and earn badges based on performance.

I built this project to practice Python GUI programming and to make learning more interactive and fun.

✨ Features

🎨 Clean & Interactive GUI using Tkinter

📂 Categories included: AI, Coding, Python (can be extended easily)

⚡ 3 Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard (changes the time limit per question)

⏳ Timed Questions — Answer within the given time limit

💡 Hints for tricky questions (with usage tracking)

📊 Scoreboard & Progress Bar

✅ Immediate feedback for each question (correct/wrong with correct answer shown)

🏆 Badges awarded based on your final score percentage

📖 Review Section — go back and check your mistakes with correct answers

🔄 Randomized Questions for each attempt


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3 – Core programming

Tkinter – For GUI interface

TTK – For styled widgets & progress bar

Random & Time Modules – For shuffling and timer control

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app.git
cd quiz-app


Run the application:

python quiz_app.py


That’s it 🎉 The quiz window should now open on your desktop.

🎯 Future Plans

I want to improve this project by:

Adding a Leaderboard so multiple users can track their scores

Storing scores in a database or file system

Supporting multimedia questions (images, audio, video)

Making a web version using Flask/Django

Adding more categories & difficulty settings

🏆 Badge System

🌟 Perfect Score → 100%

🎉 High Achiever → 80%+

👍 Good Effort → 50%+

📚 Keep Practicing → below 50%

🤝 About This Project

This project was created as part of my Python learning journey.

I wanted to explore how Tkinter works and how to make a fun, interactive application while practicing OOP concepts, event handling, and UI design.
